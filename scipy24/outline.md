### (4:10-5:00pm) Small group research projects 

The final part of the session will concentrate on enabling participants to apply what they have learned by 
working together in small groups of 2-4. Each group will choose from one of three research questions, or 
choose one of their own formulation. The instructor will be available for discussion and guidance.

### (5:00-5:30pm) Participant presentations

We will devote the final part of the session to allowing two or three participant groups to very briefly 
present their results to the room.
