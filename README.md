# censusdis-tutorial-2024

This repository contains notebooks to accompany the [SciPy 24](https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/) tutorial 
[Working with U.S. Census Data in Python: Discovery, Analysis, and Visualization
](https://cfp.scipy.org/2024/talk/BTG9U3/). 

The United States Census Bureau publishes over 1,300 data sets via its APIs. These are useful across a myriad of fields in the social sciences. 
In this interactive tutorial, attendees will learn how to use open-source Python tools to discover, download, analyze, and generate maps of U.S. Census
data.  The tutorial is full of practical examples and best practices to help participants avoid the tedium of data wrangling and concentrate on their 
research questions.

## When and Where

This tutorial will be held live on July 9th, 2024 from 1:30 to 4:30 pm in room 315 of the Tacoma Convention Center.
Tickets for this and other tutorials are available at [https://ti.to/scipy/scipy2024](https://ti.to/scipy/scipy2024).
We look forward to seeing you there.

## Environment Setup

**We strongly encourage attendees to set up a development environment with 
[Nebari](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YWMZKW6Y4tXnMs3Jekc1S7BQWTR6THZazDaq3WoNxw/edit?pli=1)
prior to attending.** We have configured Nebari to provide a web-based Jupyter notebook environment with 
everything you need for this tutorial pre-installed. Creating an account and setting up your own
environment only takes about 10 minutes.

\[Detailed steps to set up Nebari, including a coupon code, are coming soon.\]
