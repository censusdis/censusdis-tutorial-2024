## Environment Setup

Thanks to [Quantsight](), all participants have access to a web-based Nebari Jupyter notebook environment 
with everything they need for this tutorial pre-installed. 

**We strongly encourage attendees to set up your environment prior to attending.** 
Creating an account and setting up your own environment only takes about 10 minutes.
But if anything goes wrong it is easier to debug it before the tutorial starts than 
while it is going on.

To set up your environment, please follow the 
[Quantsight Nebari instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YWMZKW6Y4tXnMs3Jekc1S7BQWTR6THZazDaq3WoNxw/edit?pli=1#heading=h.iiycnjuxtvzz) 
with the following additional details:

- In step 0, the coupon code you should use is {FILL-IN-CODE}.

- In step 3, we will be using Option 2. The repository URL to clone is https://github.com/censusdis/censusdis-tutorial-2024.git

- Once you have cloned the repository, click through in the Jupyter left-nav to 
  `/censusdis-tutorial-2024/Lessons/Lesson 0 Introduction.ipynb` and run all the cells.

- If you are asked to choose a kernel. Choose `us-census-data-tutorial`.

- We will start here when the tutorial begins. See you there!
